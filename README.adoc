= Welcome to the DungeonLabs!

This isn't your typical sterile learning environment. Here, amongst flickering torches and dusty tomes, we delve into the mysteries of computer science.  By day, we conquer coding challenges and dissect algorithms. By night, we unleash our creativity, crafting 3D worlds in Blender and forging adventures in Godot.

This repository chronicles my journey â€“ a testament to the tireless pursuit of knowledge and the thrill of building something new. Join me as we delve into the dungeons and unearth the magic of code and creation!

== What you'll find within these tomes:

- **Journal:** A record of my coding conquests, trials, and triumphs. Follow along as I navigate the intricate landscapes of algorithms and data structures, unraveling their secrets.
- **Log:** A meticulous account of experiments and explorations. Witness the birth of innovative solutions and groundbreaking creations as I push the boundaries of my coding prowess.
- **Annotations:** Enlightening insights and discoveries gleaned from my coding odyssey. Gain valuable knowledge from my experiences, both successes and setbacks.
- **Brainstorms:** A chaotic tapestry of ideas, sketches, and thought experiments. Dive into the creative wellspring from which imaginative projects are born.
Embrace the adventure!

This repository is an ever-evolving testament to the power of curiosity and the joy of creation. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute your own ideas as we embark on this shared odyssey.

Let the coding commence!


My Coding & Creativity Cavern

Welcome to DevDungeon, a virtual space where I delve into the depths of computer science and explore the creative realms of 3D animation and game development! 

Here, you'll find a treasure trove of:

* **Comp Sci Notes:** A meticulously organized collection of notes, assignments, and code snippets from my coding adventures. Whether you're battling algorithms or navigating data structures, these notes might just be the key to unlocking your own coding prowess!
* **Blender Bestiary:** Witness the fruits of my labor in Blender, where I conjure 3D models, animate fantastical creatures, and craft breathtaking scenes. Prepare to be mesmerized (or mildly entertained) by my attempts to master this powerful animation software!
* **Godot Game Grotto:** Descend into the depths of my Godot game development endeavors. Here you'll find code snippets, prototypes in various stages of development, and resources I've unearthed on my journey to become a game development guru (or at least a competent game developer).

**Why DevDungeon?**

* **Solidifying Knowledge:** By meticulously crafting clear and concise notes, I solidify my understanding of complex computer science concepts.
* **Tracking Progress:** This repository serves as a visual map of my learning journey, allowing me to track my progress and celebrate milestones. 
* **Spark Inspiration:** Sharing my creative explorations with Blender and Godot might inspire others to embark on their own creative coding quests.

**Join the Quest!**

Feel free to delve into my code, notes, and projects. If you have any questions, suggestions, or simply want to chat about coding and creativity, don't hesitate to reach out! 

**Note:**

* This repository is primarily for my personal learning and exploration. Think of it as a work in progress, just like my coding skills!
* The code quality may vary, as I'm still under development (as a programmer, that is!).

**Mission & Values**

> Seek more knowledge, this is the only thing that no one can
take away from you. I can't promise that I will fulfill
my mission of leaving a legacy or what I learned for society
but I promise that I will try."

> "Without hurting anything or anyone, do what you want."

I believe that humanity has not evolved in great leaps (yes, there are outliers) but don't consider yourself one until you are one.

Referencing some animes here remember:

> "Effort always wins over natural gift."

**Let's embark on this coding and creative adventure together! Focusing in build a better future**
